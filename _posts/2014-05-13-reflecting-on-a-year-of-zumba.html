About a year ago my friend dragged me to Zumba for the first time. I was extremely nervous because I have no moves whatsoever. 
After about a month of going three times a week, I found my rhythm.  Now I'm finally brave enough to dance at the front of the class
and I'm not worried when I make mistakes. Everyone is there to have fun and get a great workout. I still am a little awkward,
but I'm much better at dancing than ever before.  I have even made it into my first <a href="http://youtu.be/8XF7c3vCpdk?t=2m37s" target="_blank">Zumba video</a>!
Going to Zumba class has not only boosted my self-esteem, it has made me healthier and happier!
